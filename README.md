# stackblitz-todos-angular-ngrx-demo

[Edit in StackBlitz next generation editor ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/~/github.com/joebalan-git/stackblitz-todos-angular-ngrx-demo)

## Platforms
I've used the [Angular](https://angular.io/), [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/) as a Reactive State Mananagement and [JsonPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as fake API for this application. I've also used the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) platform for API Request & Response and VScode as an IDE.

## Installation

After cloning the repo, do
```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

To run this application: Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder. Run `npm i` or `npm install` to install all the needed packages for the application, after that process finished. Run `ng serve` in the terminal to run the developement server of the Angular. Make sure you should install [Angular Cli](https://cli.angular.io/) before running ng serve in the terminal. Then open browser and enter the url http://localhost:4200 to run the application. You can also change the port by using this command `ng serve --port YOUR_PORT`.
<b>Note:</b> Do `ng update command` in the project folder only if the node packages are in lower version.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
